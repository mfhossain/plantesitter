# Twilio Credentials Note

## Important: Check Your Twilio Credentials

I noticed your Account SID starts with "SK" which is typically a **Signing Key**, not an **Account SID**.

### Correct Twilio Credential Formats:

#### Account SID
- ✅ **Correct format**: ``
- ❌ **Your current**: `` (This looks like a Signing Key)

#### Auth Token
- ✅ **Correct format**: ``
- ✅ **Your current**: `` (This looks correct)

### How to Get the Correct Account SID:

1. **Log into your Twilio Console**: https://console.twilio.com/
2. **Look at the dashboard** - Your Account SID is displayed prominently
3. **It should start with "AC"** not "SK"

### Example of Correct Configuration:

```typescript
twilio: {
  accountSid: '', // Should start with AC
  authToken: '', // Your current token looks correct
  fromNumber: '+' // Your Twilio phone number
}
```

### What You Need to Fix:

1. **Replace the Account SID** in both environment files:
   - `src/environments/environment.ts`
   - `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`

2. **Get the correct Account SID** from your Twilio Console dashboard

3. **Verify your Twilio phone number** is correct and supports SMS

### After Fixing:

1. **Test the build**:
   ```bash
   ng build --configuration=development
   ```

2. **Test SMS functionality**:
   - Open the chat interface
   - Select SMS channel
   - Send a test message

### Common Twilio Credential Locations:

- **Account SID**: Dashboard, Settings → General
- **Auth Token**: Settings → API Keys → Show
- **Phone Numbers**: Phone Numbers → Manage → Active numbers

Let me know once you have the correct Account SID and I can help you test the SMS functionality!
