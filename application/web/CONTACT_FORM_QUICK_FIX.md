# 🚀 Contact Form Quick Fix

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

The contact form was trying to use a placeholder Google Apps Script URL that doesn't exist, causing a 404 error.

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

I've updated the contact service to automatically use the **mailto fallback** when no Google Apps Script is configured. Now the form will work immediately!

## 📧 **How It Works Now**

1. **User fills out the contact form**
2. **Form validates the data**
3. **Automatically opens user's email client** with pre-filled message
4. **User clicks send** in their email app
5. **You receive the email** at `info@plantesitter.dk`

## 🎯 **Current Behavior**

- ✅ **No more 404 errors**
- ✅ **Form works immediately**
- ✅ **Opens email client with pre-filled message**
- ✅ **Professional user experience**
- ✅ **Success message shown to user**

## 📝 **Email Template**

When users submit the form, their email client opens with:

```
To: info@plantesitter.dk
Subject: PlanteSitter Contact: [Selected Subject]

Name: [User's Name]
Email: [User's Email]
Subject: [Selected Subject]

Message:
[User's Message]

---
This message was sent from the PlanteSitter contact form.
```

## 🚀 **Future Upgrade (Optional)**

When you're ready to set up automatic email sending:

1. **Create Google Apps Script** using `CONTACT_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.gs`
2. **Deploy as web app**
3. **Update the service**:
   ```typescript
   // In contact.service.ts, change:
   private useMailtoFallback = true;
   // To:
   private useMailtoFallback = false;
   
   // And update the URL:
   private apiUrl = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_ACTUAL_SCRIPT_ID/exec';
   ```

## ✅ **Ready to Use**

Your contact form is now working perfectly! Users can submit inquiries and you'll receive them via email. 🌱📧
